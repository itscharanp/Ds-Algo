Rearrange an array with O(1) extra space
Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]]. This should be done with O(1) extra space.

Input Format:
First line contains an integer denoting the test cases 'T'. First line of each test case contains an integer value depicting size of array 'N' and next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output Format:
Print all elements of the array after rearranging, each separated by a space, in separate line for each test case.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function arrange() which arranges the elements in the array. The printing is done automatically done by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 107
0 <= Arr[i] < N

Example:
Input:
3
2
1 0
5
4 0 2 1 3
4
3 2 0 1

Output:
0 1
3 4 2 0 1
1 0 3 2

Explanation:
Testcase 1: arr[0] = 1 and arr[arr[0]] = 0. Also, arr[1] = 0 and arr[arr[1]] = 1. So, rearranging elements, we get array as, 0 1.
Testcase 2: arr[0] = 4 and arr[arr[0]] = 3. Also, arr[1] = 0 and arr[arr[1]] = 4 and so on. So, rearranging elements, we get array as 3 4 2 0 1.
Testcase 3: arr[0] = 3 and arr[arr[0]] = 1. Also, arr[1] = 2 and arr[arr[1]] = 0 and so on. So, rearranging elements, we get array as 1 0 3 2.
