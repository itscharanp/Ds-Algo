Binary To Gray Code equivalent
You are given a decimal number N. You need to find the gray code of the number n and conver it into decimal.
To see how it's done, refer here.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer N denoting the number

Output Format:
For each test case, the output is gray code equivalent of N.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function greyConverter() which takes n parameter and returns gray code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 108

Example:
Input:
3
7
10
0

Output:
4
15
0

Explanation:
Testcase1: 7 is represented as 111 in binary form. The gray code of 111 is 100, in the binary form whose decimal equivalent is 4.
Testcase2: 10 is represented as 1010 in binary form. The gray code of 1010 is 1111, in the binary form whose decimal equivalent is 15.
Testcase3: Zero is represented as zero in binary, gray, and decimal.
